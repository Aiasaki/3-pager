	<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
	<p>Something cool about me is that I used to live in Arizona, Yuma. I had a turtle named Snowy that was a family pet. I have two sisters and one brother, I'm the eldest among my siblings, after is my seven year old sister then my three year old sister and my one year old brother. In my family we have Christmas in the beginning of March. I like to collect surprise toys, and have a stuffie collection. I have three pikachu items, a stuffed pokemon of fennekin and a Nintendo switch case of pikachu. I make goodluck stars and put them in jars or pretty bottles and give them to others when I finish, itâ€™s like making a good luck charm. I tend to collect ribbon and pretty paper to make my good luck stars. I also for some weird reason, I collect perfume and only wear some of the ones I have collected, this is the same with lipstick. I suppose I like to collect pretty things and nice smelling things along with cute things.</p>
